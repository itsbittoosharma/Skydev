# ERC20 Tokens 

## Introduction
In addition to Ether, people can create and use their own currencies on Ethereum. The most common form of currency is ERC20 tokens. ERC20 Tokens are smart contracts that fit a specific standard. Developers can extend beyond the standard, but should meet the minimum requirements when making their own token. The standardization allows for digital wallets to easily support all types of tokens, without needing specialized code for each token created.
