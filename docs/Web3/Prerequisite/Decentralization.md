# Decentralization

## Introduction
By storing data in a peer to peer network of nodes, the blockchain is a decentralized network. This has significant benefits over the traditional approach of storing data in a centralized manner. There are significant examples of problems with centralization - a few of which we will list here:

Data breaches in centralized systems expose a lot of data
Centralized authorities can censor and shut down speech
Reliance on a central authority means upstream problems affect downstream consumers (e.g. AWS going down means most of the internet goes down with it)

On the other hand, decentralization brings about the opposite benefits.

No censorship as there is no single authority or middleman that can censor you
No downtime as the overall network is running across 1000's of nodes across the globe
Highly attack resistant making it infeasible to manipulate or destroy data
