# ERC721 and ERC1155 Tokens

## Introduction
These are what are also called NFTs. These two standards, similar to ERC20, provide a base line for what requirements should be met when creating NFTs. They provide similar benefits as well, allowing wallets and NFT marketplaces to instantly be compatible with all NFT collections as they all follow one of these two standards.
