# Go Tutorial

# Introducion
Programming language Go was created by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson in 2007 while working at Google. Its syntax resembles that of C and it is statically typed. It has numerous sophisticated built-in types, including variable length arrays and key-value maps, as well as garbage collection, type safety, and dynamic typing. It also offers a comprehensive standard library. Some of Google's production systems employ the Go programming language, which was introduced in November 2009.  

## Features of Go Programming
The most important features of Go programming are listed below âˆ’

- Support for environment adopting patterns similar to dynamic languages. For example, type inference (x := 0 is valid declaration of a variable x of type int)

- Compilation time is fast.

- Inbuilt concurrency support: lightweight processes (via go routines), channels, select statement.

- Go programs are simple, concise, and safe.

- Support for Interfaces and Type embedding.

- Production of statically linked native binaries without external dependencies.

## What is Go Used For?
- Web development (server-side)
- Developing network-based programs
- Developing cross-platform enterprise applications
- Cloud-native development

## Why Golang Is Widely Used in the DevOps and Cloud Native Space?
Due to the qualities of the language, Golang is one of the most popular languages among DevOps specialists. Golang is an open source programming language created by Google to simplify, accelerate, and reliably create software. Go's built-in garbage collection, quick compilation, and good performance even when creating a large-scale project or sophisticated programme are all intended to make writing more user-friendly.
