# Computer Networks

# Introduction
Computer Network teaches both fundamental and advanced concepts of data communication and networks (DCN). Computer Networking Tutorial is important for both beginners and experienced network administrators.

## What is Computer Network
A group of devices connected by links is referred to as a computer network. A node could be a computer, a printer, or any other gadget that can send or receive data. Communication channels are the paths that connect the nodes.  
Distributed processing, which divides tasks among several computers, is used in computer networks. Instead, one computer completes the entire task, and each individual computer completes a portion of it.  

## Major components of a computer network are:
### NIC(National interface card)
A NIC is a device that facilitates communication between a computer and another device. The data-link layer protocol uses the hardware addresses found on the network interface card to identify the system on the network and direct data transfers to the intended recipient.  

### HUB
The network connection is divided among numerous devices by a hub, which is a central device. A computer will send a request to the Hub whenever it needs information from another computer. This request is sent out to all of the connected computers by the hub.

## Switches
A switch is a networking tool that gathers every device on the network so that data can be transferred to another device. A switch is preferable to a hub because it sends the message directly to the device to which it belongs rather than broadcasting it over the network. Since the message is sent directly from the source to the destination, we can say that the switch does so.  

## Cables and connectors
Cable is a transmission media that transmits the communication signals. There are three types of cables:

- **Twisted pair cable**: It is a high-speed cable that transmits the data over 1Gbps or more.
- **Coaxial cable**: Coaxial cable resembles like a TV installation cable. Coaxial cable is more expensive than twisted pair cable, but it provides the high data transmission speed.
- **Fibre optic cable**: Fibre optic cable is a high-speed cable that transmits the data using light beams. It provides high data transmission speed as compared to other cables. It is more expensive as compared to other cables, so it is installed at the government level.

### Router
The device that connects the LAN to the internet is a router. The router is primarily used to link various networks together or to connect multiple computers to the internet.  

### Modem
The modem uses the phone line already in place to connect the computer to the internet. The motherboard of a computer does not incorporate a modem. A modem is a separate component on the motherboard's PC slot.

## Uses Of Computer Network
- **Resource sharing**: Resource sharing refers to the distribution of network resources, such as software, printers, and data, among users without regard to the physical locations of the users or the resources.
- **Server-Client model**: The server-client model makes advantage of computer networking. A server is a major computer that the system administrator maintains and uses to store data. Clients are the devices used to remotely view the data held on the server.
- **Communication medium**: Computer networks function as a channel for users to exchange information. For instance, a business with several computers can have an email system that staff members utilise on a regular basis.
- **E-commerce**: Computer networks are essential to companies. The transaction may be completed online. For instance, amazon.com does business online; that is, they conduct business online.
