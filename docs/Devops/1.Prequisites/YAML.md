# YAML

## Introduction
The DevOps Engineer needs to understand both fundamental and complex YAML concepts. Both professionals and beginners should learn YAML. Developers must understand how to develop correct YAML, encompassing all YAML-related issues, such as what YAML is, YAML syntax, YAML data types, YAML styles, mapping key-value pairs, and YAML structure. Using YAML, we can collect information about numerous hosts and our infrastructure.

## What is YAML
- YAML means yet another markup language. It is a data serialization language that works well with the modern programming language, and it is human-friendly.
- It is used to define the data structures that are very easy to understand. These data structures are very easy to manage and maintain by the users.
- YAML uses space to define something. If we use a single space or double space, it has different meanings in YAML. Spaces change the meaning of data structure.
- YAML is case sensitive.
- YAML is language independent. If we define the YAML once, the same YAML file can be invoked in Python file, Ruby, etc.
- When it first came out, YAML was really helpful and accommodating for data workers. Unicode printable characters are used in YAML. Some characters in Unicode give structural information, whereas others just convey data. Using the least amount of structural characters possible, YAML can attain a distinct cleanness. YAML is used to display the data in a natural and comprehensible manner. For instance, dashes may be used to make bullet lists, a colon can be used to divide key-value pairs, and indentation can be used to form structures. 
- The data structure has several variations in YAML. The three fundamental primitives can appropriately represent the data structure. Scalars, sequences, and mapping are the fundamental primitives. YAML makes use of these primitives and, if we wish to create a full language for data serialisation, it also includes an aliasing mechanism and a simple type system. The majority of programming languages utilise YAML for data serialisation. However, YAML excels at interacting with languages that are based on fundamental constructs like scalars, sequences, and mapping. The latest agile languages, such as Ruby, PHP, JavaScript, Python, and Perl, are among them. 
- The YAML language was specially intended to function well with the usual use cases. Cross-language data sharing, log files, complicated data structure debugging, interprocess communications, object persistence, and configuration files are typical use cases. The programming becomes simple when the data is simple to inspect and comprehend.  

## Goals of YAML
- **Human-readable**: YAML is human readable. Humans can easily read it.
- **Portable**: YAML can work across multiple programming languages easily.
- **Consistent**: YAML is consistent, and it is able to support generic tools.
- **Support various languages**: YAML matches the native data structure of agile methodologies like PHP, JavaScript, Perl, Ruby, and Python.
One-pass processing: when a programming language goes through the YAML file, it only needs to go through once to complete its task.
- **Extensive and expressive**: YAML is extensive, that means it should be easily readable by the human, and it is expressive.
- **Easy Implementation**: The implementation of YAML is easy and useful.

## Prerequisite
Before learning YAML, you should have basic knowledge of basic computer functionality, basic mathematics, computer language, and logical operators.
