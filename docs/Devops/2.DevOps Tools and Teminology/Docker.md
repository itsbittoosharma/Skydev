# Docker 

# Introduction
An organised platform for packaging, delivering, and executing programmes is called Docker. Before Docker, a common issue faced by consumers was that some programmes would execute on the developer's computer but not on the user's. Docker was created primarily to aid developers in creating apps quickly, shipping them in containers so they could be deployed anywhere.  
Docker was firstly released in March 2013. It is used in the Deployment stage of the software development life cycle that's why it can efficiently resolve issues related to the application deployment.

## What is Docker?

An open-source centralised platform called Docker is used to build, distribute, and operate programmes. Applications are executed by Docker using containers on the host's operating system. Instead of building a full virtual operating system, it enables apps to use the same Linux kernel as a system on the host computer. Our programme will function in every environment, including development, testing, and production, thanks to containers.  

## Docker Containers
The more portable substitutes for virtual machines are called Docker containers. It enables developers to compile and deploy the programme as a single package with all of its libraries and dependencies. Using a docker container has the benefit of eliminating the need to set aside any RAM or disc space for the apps. According to the needs of the application, storage and space are automatically generated.  

## Virtual Machine
A virtual machine is a piece of software that enables us to concurrently install and run Windows, Linux, and Debian on our computer. Virtualized operating systems are the operating systems that host virtual machines. These virtualized operating systems are capable of running applications and carrying out duties that a true operating system would.  

## Container vs Virtual Machine
- Integration in a container is faster and cheap whereas slow and costly in virtual machine.
- No wastage of memory in Container whereas Virtual Machine require extra space.
- Container uses the same kernel, but different distribution whereas Virtual machine uses multiple independent operating systems.

## Why Docker?
Docker is designed to benefit both the Developer and System Administrator. There are the following reasons to use Docker -  
- Docker allows us to easily install and run software without worrying about setup or dependencies.
- Developers use Docker to eliminate machine problems, i.e. "but code is worked on my laptop." when working on code together with co-workers.
- Operators use Docker to run and manage apps in isolated containers for better compute density.
- Enterprises use Docker to securely built agile software delivery pipelines to ship new application features faster and more securely.
- Since docker is not only used for the deployment, but it is also a great platform for development, that's why we can efficiently increase our customer's satisfaction.
