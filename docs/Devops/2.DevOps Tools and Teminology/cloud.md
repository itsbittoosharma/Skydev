# Cloud Computing

# Introduction
Through the use of virtualization-based technology called cloud computing, we are able to design, set up, and modify programmes online. A hard drive, software programme, database, and development platform are all components of cloud technology.
The term cloud refers to a network or the internet. It is a technology that uses remote servers on the internet to store, manage, and access data online rather than local drives. The data can be anything such as files, images, documents, audio, video, and more.  

## Why Cloud Computing?
Both small and large IT firms supply IT infrastructure using conventional techniques. This means that a server room is a need for all IT organisations and is their fundamental demand.  

A database server, mail server, networking equipment, firewalls, routers, modems, switches, QPS (Query Per Second, which indicates how many requests or loads the server will manage), customizable system, fast internet speed, and maintenance engineers should all be present in one server room.  

To establish such IT infrastructure, we need to spend lots of money. To overcome all these problems and to reduce the IT infrastructure cost, Cloud Computing comes into existence.  

## Characteristics of Cloud Computing
1. **Agility**: The cloud works in a distributed computing environment. It shares resources among users and works very fast.

2. **High availability and reliability**: The availability of servers is high and more reliable because the chances of infrastructure failure are minimum.
3. **High Scalability**: Cloud offers "on-demand" provisioning of resources on a large scale, without having engineers for peak loads.
4. **Multi-Sharing**: With the help of cloud computing, multiple users and applications can work more efficiently with cost reductions by sharing common infrastructure.
5.  **Device and Location Independence**: Employing a web browser, users may access systems using cloud computing regardless of where they are or what device they are using, such as a PC, smartphone, etc. Users can join from anywhere since the infrastructure is off-site (usually provided by a third party) and accessed over the Internet.
6.  **Maintenance**: Maintenance of cloud computing applications is easier, since they do not need to be installed on each user's computer and can be accessed from different places. So, it reduces the cost also.
7.  **Low Cost**: By using cloud computing, the cost will be reduced because to take the services of cloud computing, IT company need not to set its own infrastructure and pay-as-per usage of resources.
8.  **Services in the pay-per-use mode**: Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are provided to the users so that they can access services on the cloud by using these APIs and pay the charges as per the usage of services.
