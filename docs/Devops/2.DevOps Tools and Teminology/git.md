# Git and GitHub

# Introduction
Git is a distributed version management system that is open-source. It is made to manage small to large jobs quickly and effectively. It was created to organise the development team's work. We can keep track of each other's work and collaborate in the same workspace thanks to version control.   

Git is foundation of many services like GitHub and GitLab, but we can use Git without using any other Git services. Git can be used privately and publicly.

Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 to develop Linux Kernel. It is also used as an important distributed version-control tool for the DevOps.

Git is easy to learn, and has fast performance. It is superior to other SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase.  

## Features of Git

Some remarkable features of Git are as follows:

- **Open Source**: Git is an open-source tool. It is released under the GPL (General Public License) license.
- **Scalable**: Git is scalable, which means when the number of users increases, the Git can easily handle such situations.  
- **Distributed**: The fact that Git is distributed is one of its best qualities. Distributed simply implies that we may "clone" the complete repository rather than moving the project to a different computer. Additionally, each user has their own repository that has the complete project commit history rather than just one central repository to which you may submit modifications. The modification is simply stored on our local repository; we do not need to connect to the external repository. We may upload these modifications to a remote repository if necessary.  

## Benefits of Git
We can keep track of all the changes we make to the project files using a version control programme. We may push updates to a repository each time we make modifications to files belonging to an active project. It is OK for other developers to grab your revisions from the repository and go on working with the project files that you updated.  

Some significant benefits of using Git are as follows:
- **Saves Time**: Technology is lightning quick with Git. When opposed to signing into a GitHub account to explore its capabilities, each command just takes a few seconds to run.  
- **Offline Working**: The fact that Git permits offline working is one of its most significant advantages. Our ability to connect to the internet will not interfere with our ability to do our jobs. We can practically accomplish anything locally with Git. In contrast, alternative CVS, like SVN, are more constrained and favour connections to the central repository.  
- **Undo Mistakes**: Git also offers the ability to undo errors. The undo function can save us from ourselves on occasion. Git nearly always includes an undo option.
- **Track the Changes**: Git makes it easy to monitor changes using tools like Diff, Log, and Progress, which let us compare our files or branches or check the status.  

## Why Git?
We've spoken about a lot of Git's features and advantages, which prove that it is unquestionably the best version control system. We will now talk about some additional reasons for choosing Git.   

- **Trendy Version Control System**: The most popular version control programme is called Git. Compared to all other version control systems, it has the most projects. Developers choose it because of its fantastic features and workflow.
- **Git Integrity**: Git was created to guarantee the integrity and security of material that is version managed. To ensure that data is not lost either in transit or during file system manipulation, it employs checksums. When sending or saving data, it internally generates a checksum value from the file's content and then validates it.  
- **Collaborate to Public Projects**: On GitHub, there are a lot of open source projects available. On those initiatives, we may work together and demonstrate our ideas to the world. Public initiatives involve the cooperation of several developers. The partnership advances our programming abilities because it enables us to work with seasoned developers and learn a lot from them.
