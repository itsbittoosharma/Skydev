## What is an abstract class?
An abstract class is a special class containing abstract methods. The significance of
abstract class is that the abstract methods inside it are not implemented and only
declared. So as a result, when a subclass inherits the abstract class and needs to use
its abstract methods, they need to define and implement them.
