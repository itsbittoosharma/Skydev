# Graphs

## Introduction
A lot of graph problems are covered by DFS, BFS, topo sort in general -> but we’re going to do a general overview of everything related to graphs. There are other algorithms like Djikstra’s, MST, and others - which are covered in the greedy algorithms section.
A lot of graph problems are synced with other types = dynamic programming, trees, DFS, BFS, topo sort, and much more. You can think of those topics sort of coming under the umbrella of graph theory sometimes.
