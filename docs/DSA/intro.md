# Complete Data structures and Algorithms Roadmap

This tutorial covered all of the incredible data structures and algorithms that you will be required to study in order to land that next opportunity. Hopefully, this will help you become a better problem solver, developer, and ace your next technical coding interview.

## Aim
- The goal of this roadmap is to help you become a better problem solver by learning about various data structures, algorithms, and patterns.
- To Understand Data structure and algorithms which aid in a deeper understanding of the nature of the problem and, as a result, a better understanding of the world.
- Most phone interviews require you to be a good communicator and explain your approach before you write the solution. As a result, it's critical to first grasp the fundamentals before moving on to more advanced topics.

Building and developing something is at the heart of computer science, so if you're truly interested, you should spend the majority of your time learning new frameworks and building stuff. **Exploration is another important aspect of coding and life in general!** Keep exploring and learning because the more you explore, the closer you get to your interests.

## Practice

- The key is to be consistent. You must work through this guide at your own pace. Take your time, revisit topics after a while, read and watch a lot of videos, and eventually you'll be comfortable with problem solving!
- Practicing 150-200 questions will give you the confidence to tackle any new problem.
This is only answering two questions for 75 days, which isn't much when you think about it!
- This guide contains mixed up blogs of data structures and algorithms, which are sequentially arranged in order to learn in a particular way.
