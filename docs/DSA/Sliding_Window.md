# Sliding Window

## Introduction
This is super useful when you have questions regarding sub-strings and sub-sequences for arrays
and strings. Think of it as a window which slides to the right or left as we iterate through the
string/array.  
Sliding window is a 2 pointer problem where the front pointer explores the array and the back pointer closes in on the window. Hereâ€™s an awesome visualization to understand it more: [Dynamic Programming - Sliding Window](https://algorithm-visualizer.org/dynamic-programming/sliding-window)
