# HashMap/Tables

## Introduction

A hash table is a data structure that implements the associative array abstract data type, which can map keys to values. In other words, key value pairs can be used to store anything.  
Example: map<string, string> denotes a hashmap containing string key and value pairs.  

## Basic Operations on HashMap
The HashMap class provides various methods to perform different operations on hashmaps. We will look at some commonly used arraylist operations in this tutorial:

- Add elements.
- Access elements.
- Change elements.
- Remove elements.
