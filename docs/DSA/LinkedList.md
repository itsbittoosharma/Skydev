# LinkedList

## Introduction  
A linked list is a data structure that stores objects in snake-like nodes. We have nodes in the linked list instead of an array (where we have a simple list to store something). But it's the same thing; you can store whatever you want - objects, numbers, strings, and so on.  
The only difference is in the way it’s represented. It’s like a snake: with a head and tail, and you can only access one thing at a time - giving its own advantages and disadvantages. So if you want to access the 5th thing, you can’t do linked_list[5], instead -> you would have to iterate over the list from the beginning and then stop when the number hits 5.
