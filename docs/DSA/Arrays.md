# Arrays

## Introduction
Informally, an array is a collection of items. It makes no difference what the things are; they could be numbers, words, apple trees, or any other array. Each item or element in an array is referred to as an item or element. Usually, arrays
are enclosed in brackets with each item separated by commas, like this: [1, 2, 3]. The elements of [1, 2,3] are 1, 2, and 3.

Arrays are used with a variety of data structures to solve various problems, so it's difficult to come up with array questions using only array logic. Let's go over some of the most well-known patterns that mostly deal with arrays.  

2D matrices are arrays as well and are frequently asked in interviews. There is a lot of graph, DP, and search.  Based questions require the use of a 2D matrix, and it is critical to understand the fundamental concepts there. Make sure to read through each section below to learn about the common patterns.
