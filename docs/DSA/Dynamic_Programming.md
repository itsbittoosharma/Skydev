# Dynamic Programming

## Introduction
Dynamic programming is nothing but recursion + memoization. If someone tells you anything outside of this, share this resource with them. The only way to get good at dynamic programming is to be good at recursion first. You definitely need to understand the magic of recursion and memoization before jumping to dynamic programming.
The day when you solve a new question alone, using the core concepts of dynamic programming -> you’ll be much more confident after that.  

So if you’ve skipped the recursion, backtracking, and memoization section -> go back and complete those first! If you’ve completed it, keep reading. You will only get better at dynamic programming (and problem solving in general) by solving more recursion (logical) problems.
