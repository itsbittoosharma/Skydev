## What is an object?

An object refers to the instance of the class, which contains the instance of the
members and behaviors defined in the class template. In the real world, an object is
an actual entity to which a user interacts, whereas class is just the blueprint for that
object. So the objects consume space and have some characteristic behavior.
For example, a specific car.
