## What is meant by Inheritance?
The term “inheritance” means “receiving some quality or behavior from a parent to
an offspring.” In object-oriented programming, inheritance is the mechanism by
which an object or class (referred to as a child) is created using the definition of
another object or class (referred to as a parent). Inheritance not only helps to keep
the implementation simpler but also helps to facilitate code reuse.

#### Explain Inheritance with an example?
Inheritance is one of the major features of object-oriented programming, by which an
entity inherits some characteristics and behaviors of some other entity and makes
them their own. Inheritance helps to improve and facilitate code reuse.
Let me explain to you with a common example. Let's take three different vehicles - a
car, truck, or bus. These three are entirely different from one another with their own
specific characteristics and behavior. But. in all three, you will find some common
elements, like steering wheel, accelerator, clutch, brakes, etc. Though these
elements are used in different vehicles, still they have their own features which are
common among all vehicles. This is achieved with inheritance. The car, the truck, and
the bus have all inherited the features like steering wheel, accelerator, clutch, brakes,
etc, and used them as their own. Due to this, they did not have to create these
components from scratch, thereby facilitating code reuse.

####  Are there any limitations of Inheritance?
Yes, with more powers comes more complications. Inheritance is a very powerful
feature in OOPs, but it has some limitations too. Inheritance needs more time to
process, as it needs to navigate through multiple classes for its implementation. Also,
the classes involved in Inheritance - the base class and the child class, are very tightly
coupled together. So if one needs to make some changes, they might need to do
nested changes in both classes. Inheritance might be complex for implementation, as
well. So if not correctly implemented, this might lead to unexpected errors or
incorrect outputs.

#### What are the various types of inheritance?
The various types of inheritance include:
1. Single inheritance
2. Multiple inheritances
3. Multi-level inheritance
4. Hierarchical inheritance
5. Hybrid inheritance
