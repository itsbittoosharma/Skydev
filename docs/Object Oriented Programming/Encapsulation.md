## What is encapsulation?
One can visualize Encapsulation as the method of putting everything that is required
to do the job, inside a capsule and presenting that capsule to the user. What it means
is that by Encapsulation, all the necessary data and methods are bind together and
all the unnecessary details are hidden to the normal user. So Encapsulation is the
process of binding data members and methods of a program together to do a specific
job, without revealing unnecessary details.
Encapsulation can also be defined in two different ways:
1) Data hiding: Encapsulation is the process of hiding unwanted information, such as
restricting access to any member of an object.
2) Data binding: Encapsulation is the process of binding the data members and the
methods together as a whole, as a class.
