## What is a constructor?
Constructors are special methods whose name is the same as the class name. The
constructors serve the special purpose of initializing the objects.
For example, suppose there is a class with the name “MyClass”, then when you
instantiate this class, you pass the syntax:
MyClass myClassObject = new MyClass();
Now here, the method called aConstructors are special methods whose name is the same as the class name. The
constructors serve the special purpose of initializing the objects.
For example, suppose there is a class with the name “MyClass”, then when you
instantiate this class, you pass the syntax:
MyClass myClassObject = new MyClass();
Now here, the method.
#### What are the various types of constructors in C++?
The most common classification of constructors includes:
1. Default constructor: The default constructor is the constructor which doesn’t take
any argument. It has no parameters.
```
class ABC
{
int x;
ABC()
{
x = 0;
}
}
```
2. Parameterized constructor: The constructors that take some arguments are known
as parameterized constructors
```
class ABC
{
int x;
ABC(int y)
{
x = y;
}
}
```
3. Copy constructor: A copy constructor is a member function that initializes an object
using another object of the same class.
```
class ABC
{
int x;
ABC(int y)
{
x = y;
}
// Copy constructor
ABC(ABC abc)
{
x = abc.x;
}
}
```
### What is a copy constructor?
Copy Constructor is a type of constructor, whose purpose is to copy an object to
another. What it means is that a copy constructor will clone an object and its values,
into another object, is provided that both the objects are of the same class.
